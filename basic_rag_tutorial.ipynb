    "## Introduction to RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of retrieval-based systems with generative AI to create more accurate, informative, and contextually relevant responses. Instead of relying solely on the knowledge encoded in a language model's parameters, RAG systems first retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base and then use that information to generate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components of a RAG system include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Collection**: A corpus of documents containing domain-specific information\n",
    "2. **Document Processing**: Converting raw documents into a format suitable for embedding\n",
    "3. **Chunking**: Breaking documents into smaller, manageable pieces\n",
    "4. **Embedding**: Converting text chunks into vector representations\n",
    "5. **Vector Storage**: Storing embeddings in a vector database for efficient retrieval\n",
    "6. **Retrieval**: Finding the most relevant chunks for a given query\n",
    "7. **Augmentation**: Combining the query with retrieved context\n",
    "8. **Generation**: Using an LLM to generate a response based on the augmented prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll build a complete RAG system from scratch and see it in action!\n",

      "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating an [information-retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval \"Information retrieval\") mechanism that allows models to access and utilize additional data beyond their original training set. [AWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWS \"AWS\") states, \"RAG allows LLMs to retrieve relevant information from external data sources to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses\" (**indexing**).[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation#cite_note-AWS-4) This approach reduces reliance on static datasets, which can quickly become outdated. When a user submits a query, RAG uses a document retriever to search for relevant content from available sources before incorporating the retrieved information into the model’s response (**retrieval**). _Ars Technica_ notes that \"when new information becomes available, rather than having to retrain the model, all that’s needed is to augment the model’s external knowledge base with the updated information\" (**augmentation**).[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation#cite_note-:0-5) By dynamically integrating relevant data, RAG enables LLMs to generate more informed and contextually grounded responses (**generation**). IBM states that \"in the generative phase, the LLM draws from the augmented prompt and its internal representation of its training data to synthesize an engaging answer tailored to the user in that instant.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation#cite_note-:1-1)\n",

      "Before 2017, there were a few language models that were large as compared to capacities then available. In the 1990s, the IBM alignment models pioneered statistical language modelling. A smoothed n-gram model in 2001 trained on 0.3 billion words achieved state-of-the-art perplexity at the time.[4] In the 2000s, as Internet use became prevalent, some researchers constructed Internet-scale language datasets (\"web as corpus\"[5]), upon which they trained statistical language models.[6][7] In 2009, in most language processing tasks, statistical language models dominated over symbolic language models because they can usefully ingest large datasets.[8]\n",

Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer LLMs by discovering symbolic algorithms that approximate the inference performed by an LLM. One example is Othello-GPT, where a small Transformer is trained to predict legal Othello moves. It is found that there is a linear representation of the Othello board, and modifying the representation changes the predicted legal Othello moves in the correct way.[106][107] In another example, a small Transformer is trained on Karel programs. Similar to the Othello-GPT example, there is a linear representation of Karel program semantics, and modifying the representation changes output in the correct way. The model also generates correct programs that are on average shorter than those in the training set.[108]\n",

They are trained on vast amounts of text data to learn patterns and relationships within the language, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. These models have shown emergent abilities in various linguistic tasks and have been applied in natural language processing tasks such as translation, summarization, and question-answering [1].\n",

They are often considered black boxes, meaning it is challenging to understand how they arrive at specific results or perform linguistic tasks.

      "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) improves factual accuracy compared to standard LLMs by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely solely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources, allowing AI to provide more accurate responses without frequent retraining. This method helps reduce AI hallucinations and improves performance by blending the LLM process with a web search or document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts. RAG also reduces the need for users to continuously train the model on new data and update its parameters, lowering the computational and financial costs of running LLM-powered chatbots in an enterprise setting [4].\n",

      "While RAG improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs), it does not eliminate all challenges. One limitation is that while RAG reduces the need for frequent model retraining, it does not remove it entirely. Additionally, LLMs may struggle to recognize when they lack sufficient information to provide a reliable response. Without specific training, models may generate answers even when they should indicate uncertainty. According to [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\"), this issue can arise when the model lacks the ability to assess its own knowledge limitations.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation#cite_note-:1-1)\n",

      "RAG systems may retrieve factually correct but misleading sources, leading to errors in interpretation. In some cases, an LLM may extract statements from a source without considering its context, resulting in an incorrect conclusion. Additionally, when faced with conflicting information, RAG models may struggle to determine which source is accurate and may combine details from multiple sources, producing responses that merge outdated and updated information in a misleading way.
