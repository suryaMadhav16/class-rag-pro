# Frontend Documentation Scratchpad

This scratchpad contains notes and observations about the frontend codebase as each file is analyzed. It will be used to build comprehensive documentation.

## Project Overview

The frontend is a Streamlit application that provides a chat interface for interacting with the backend RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

## Analysis Log

### app.py

**File Path:** `/frontend/app.py`

**Purpose:** Main Streamlit application file that serves as the entry point for the frontend.

**Key Components:**
- `main()`: Primary function that configures the Streamlit page and orchestrates the UI components
- `display_chat_history()`: Renders the chat messages in a conversational interface format

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses Streamlit's chat interface components (`st.chat_message`, `st.chat_input`)
- Sets up custom CSS for styling the chat interface (making user messages right-aligned, assistant messages left-aligned)
- Handles the display of various message types including tools, sources, and suggested questions
- Implements a system for processing follow-up questions through buttons

**Dependencies:**
- Imports components from `frontend.components`
- Imports utility functions from `frontend.utils`
- Uses configuration constants from `frontend.config` 

**Notes:**
- The application follows a clean structure with separation of concerns
- The UI is responsive with custom styling for chat messages
- The code includes comments explaining the purpose of each section
- The chat interface includes special handling for different message elements like tools, sources, and suggested questions
- A specific flow for handling pending questions is implemented
